:smiley:Welcome to my blog! My name is Wang Jianghai(王江海 in Chinese). I am currently a PhD student in NTU, Singapore:mortar_board:, majoring in computational materials science. My research focuses on crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, and I am interested in the evolution of computational materials science led by artificial intelligence.



I will share my study and life experience here, I hope you can find resonance with me here!
