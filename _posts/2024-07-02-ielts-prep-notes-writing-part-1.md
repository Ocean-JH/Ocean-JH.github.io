> **General advice**:
> 
> *The report must consist of¬†an **introduction** which says what your graph, chart, process or map¬†shows and for what period of time; an **overview** which summarises the key features;¬†and **body paragraphs (one or two)** that describe and compare the key features in detail using data and units of measurement. Do not use titles or bullet points in your report.*
> 
> *You need to start your Task 1 answer with an introduction to the graph, chart, process or map. You need to write what the graph, chart, process or map shows and over which period of time. It‚Äôs important to paraphrase the question and not copy the words directly.*
> 
> *An overview is a summary of the key features of the graph, chart, process or map. It can come after the introduction or at the end. It must be accurate, and it shouldn‚Äôt include any data nor any detail.*
> 
> *When writing an overview for a **process**, state the number of stages there are and what generally happens during the stages. Depending on the type of process, you may also want to mention if it is a man-made or natural process, what is produced and if it is cyclical or linear.*
> 
> *Make sure you identify the main trends of the overall **map** when writing an overview. ¬†Focus on the main changes that you can see. Have they improved anything? Have they built anything in an area where there was nothing before? Have there been any dramatic changes?*
> 
> *An overview is a summary of the key features of the **graph or chart**. These are the things that are considered to be most important. They could be a comparison of different categories over time, how large the changes were, and if anything remained unchanged. When dealing with two sets of data try and identify a connection between the two graphs or charts if possible but be careful not to give your own opinion about any connections that may exist.*
> 
> *The body paragraph(s) describe the key features summarised in the overview in more detail. Your description must be accurate, contain enough detail and use figures and units of measurement. Be sure to make comparisons where appropriate.*

#### Describing change more specifically

- use data from the graph

- use dates

- more accurate subjects

#### Describing Line Graphs and Two Sets of Data

##### Line graphs

**Analysing line graphs**

- understand it before writing

- look at the title

- look at the x and y axis and what they represent

- look at the different lines

- past / present / future

- small / big change

- main features

**Main features**

- can't talk about everything

- can you group anything?

- biggest changes

- comparisons

##### Two Sets of Data

- same as with one graph

- analyse question

- analyse the graphs

- one paragraph for each graph

- comparisons where necessary

- select main features

> **General advice**:
> 
> *It is important to look at the graph in detail and make sure you understand exactly what it is showing. Line graphs will usually show fixed percentages or numbers over a period of time, often a year or some months. Make sure to check the time shown. Is it past, present or a future prediction?*
> 
> *You could be given a line graph and a bar chart, a pie chart and a line graph or any other combination of graphs and charts. Tackle these in the same way you would for any other graph or chart. It is important to look at the graphs or charts in detail and make sure you understand exactly what they are showing. Check both axes (the vertical and horizontal lines) in graphs, the units of measurement used and what the graphs or charts are generally showing you.*
> 
> *The instructions ask you to select the main features from the graph. These are the most important features. You don‚Äôt need to write about everything in the chart. Make sure you identify the main trends and don‚Äôt write too much detail about the less important ones.*
> 
> *Remember to compare and contrast the important sets of data. This may be data that is very similar or very different. It may also be data that represents a change. Make sure these differences are highlighted clearly.*
> 
> *You must include data in your response. Remember to make sure your data is categorised and described accurately. Be sure to include the correct unit of measurement. Make sure you check how the data is presented in the chart (percentage, amount, time etc.).*

### Bar Charts / Tables / Pie Charts

#### Making General Comparisons

- line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, tables

- maps

***Basic structures with 'more' and 'less'***

1. X + is / are + more / less + *adj.* + than +Y

2. There is / are + more / less + *n.* + of + X + than + Y

3. X + *v.* + more / less + *n.* + than + Y

4. *n.* + of + X + is / are + more / less + than + Y

***Synonyms***

- half - 50 percent

- the same as - equal to

- just over - slightly more than

- nearly - almost

- a lot more than - well over

- a bit - marginally

#### Making Detailed Comparisons

***Linking words***

- Linking an adverb to a clause:
  
  - <u>In comparison with / In contrast to</u> B, A has a larger amount.

- Linking two clauses:
  
  - A has 200 <u>while / whereas</u> B has 140.

- Linking two sentences:
  
  - A has 200. <u>However,</u> B has 140.
  
  - A has 200. <u>In comparison, / In contrast,</u> B has 140.

Examples:

- The average amount of meat consumed in Brazil is <u>more than 15 times that of</u> in India.

- The amount of meat consumed in India is <u>one fifteenth of that</u> in Brazil.

- Alcohol consumption in India is <u>half as much as</u> in India.

- Brazil consumes <u>twice / two times / double the amount of</u> alcohol <u>as</u> India.

- Brazil consumes 6.02 kg of coffee per person <u>while</u> the US consumes 3.1, <u>which is about half</u>.

- Coffee consumption in the US <u>of 3.1 kg per person a year</u> is roughly <u>100 times more than</u> in India, <u>which is only 0.03</u>.

> **General advice**:
> 
> *It is important to look at the graph / chart / table in detail and make sure you understand exactly what it is showing.*
> 
> - **Bar charts** will usually show fixed percentages or numbers for a period of time, often a year or some months. Make sure you¬†check the time shown. Is it past, present or a future prediction?
> 
> - **Tables** will usually show numbers for specific groups in different times and sometimes a total or an average. Make sure you check the figures in the table and understand how they are presented.
> 
> - **Pie charts** will usually show amounts as a percentage between two time periods, locations or reasons for doing something. Make sure to check time periods and which categories are presented in which pie charts.
> 
> *The instructions ask you to select the main features from the chart / table. These are the most important features. You don‚Äôt need to write about everything in the chart. Make sure you identify the main trends and don‚Äôt write too much detail about the less important ones.*
> 
> *Remember to compare and contrast the important sets of data. This may be data that is very similar or very different. It may also be data that represents a change. Make sure these differences are highlighted clearly.*
> 
> *You must include data in your response. Remember to make sure your data is categorised and described accurately. Be sure to include the correct unit of measurement. Make sure to check how the data is presented in the chart (percentage, amount, time etc.).*

### Maps

#### Physical Changes

*Maps show physical changes from one time to another.*

- locations

- verbs of change

***Vocabulary for describing change and locations***

***Change***

- Create - build / construct / add / install (facilities)

- Destory
  
  - buildings - knock down / pull down / tear (torn) down / demolish
  
  - natural areas - remove / cut down (trees) / clear (fields) / flatten

- Change - move / relocate / renovate / reconstruct / convert (into) / transform (into) / replace (with)

- Get bigger / smaller - expand / extend / enlarge / grow / shrink / increase (decrease) in size

***Positions on a map***

- in the centre / north / south / west / east

- to the north / south / west / east of ...

- next to / beside / above / below

- to the right / left of ...

Example:

- Lenton Woods has been¬†*cut down*¬†and replaced¬†*with*¬†a housing estate.

- The fields in the¬†*southwes*t have been¬†*cleared*¬†and a cinema and railway station have been¬†*built / constructed*.

- Just¬†*above*¬†Lenton housing estate, Lord Westley's house has been¬†*converted into*¬†The Red Lion Pub and Lenton Hotel.

- The residential area has¬†*expanded / grown*¬†and now also includes businesses and shops.

#### Grammar for maps

- two maps in the past - past simple

- one map in the past and one map now - mostly present perfect / past simple / present simple

- one map in the past and one map in the future - past simple / future forms

- one map now and one map in the future - present simple / future forms

- a lot of ***passive forms***

- some active forms

- ***comparative structures***

Example:

- Lenton Woods *has been cut down and replaced* with a housing estate.

- The museum *will be converted* into a primary school.

- The city is going to become less agricultural. Most of the farms *will be cleared* to make way for new houses and shops.

- Jammers Park *was replaced* with an industrial estate.

Overall, Westley has seen some dramatic transformations throughout the time period. It has gone from being an agricultural area with some housing and lots of trees to a much more residential and commercial area. A number of key additions have also been made including a shopping centre, train line, pub and hotel.

> **General advice**:
> 
> *It is important to look at the map in detail and make sure you understand exactly what it is showing. It might be outside in a city or inside in a building. Maps will usually show changes to a place that have happened (in the past) or changes that are going to happen (future) and you may have to compare these with the present day. Make sure you understand what kinds of features are being shown in the map; this could be roads, buildings, parks, rooms, or hallways.*
> 
> *The instructions ask you to select the main features from the map. These are the most important features. You don‚Äôt need to write about everything in the chart. Make sure you identify the locations of different features of the map and things that have changed. Don‚Äôt write too much detail about the less important ones.*
> 
> *Remember to compare and contrast the important features of the map. This may be features that are very similar or very different. It may also be features that have changed maybe in size, location or things that have appeared or disappeared. Make sure these differences are highlighted clearly.*
> 
> *You must include data in your response. In a map, this data must take the form of the location of the key features on the map. This could be North, South, East or West, distance or the location of a feature in relation to another one. Remember to make sure your data is categorised and described accurately. Make sure to check how the data is presented in the map¬†(direction, location, distance etc.).*

### Processes

- Stages of a process

- Natural process, mechanical system or manufacturing process

- No data

- Useful language:
  
  - passives
  
  - linking language: sequencing
  
  - linking language: cause and effect

**Understanding the diagram**

- Read the question

- How many diagrams?

- Where does it happen?

- Cyclical or linear?

- How many stages?

- Where does it start / finish?

- Can we compare and contrast anything?

- What do the labels refer to?

#### Sequencing language

***Once / When***¬†the kaolinite has been extracted from the ground, it is transported to a factory where it is mixed with water in large containers. This clay is¬†***then / subsequently***¬†pushed through a tube and cut into pieces with a wire.¬†***Next / After that***, a conveyor belt transports the pieces of clay to a hydraulic press, which presses the pieces so they become flatter, in the shape of the plate.

#### Cause / effect language

During the day, the sun heats the land, ***causing*** the air above it ***to*** become hotter. ***As a result***, this hot air rises and ***so*** it pulls in air from the sea. ***This means that*** during the day, the wind blows towards the land, whereas at night the wind travels in the opposite direction. ***This is due to*** the cooling of the land during the night while the sea stays the same temperature.

#### Planning your paragraphs

- **Introduction**: paraphrase the question - What does it show?

- **Overview**:
  
  - two diagrams - main differences
  
  - one diagram - number of stages + first and last

- **Body paragraphs**:
  
  - two diagrams - features of both diagrams that are similar / different
  
  - one diagram - the whole stages
