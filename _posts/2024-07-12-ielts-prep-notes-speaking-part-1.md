### Prepare & Revise

> **General advice:** 
> 
> - *Remember, speaking part 1 is all about YOU! You can prepare for the exam by making mindmaps or other study aids on different topics from your life.*
> 
> - *Remember to extend your answers with linking words like ‘because’, ‘and’, and ‘but’. But remember, in the speaking test, you don’t need to use very formal linking words - the simple linking words are fine!*
> 
> - *Remember to extend your answers with linking words like ‘because’, ‘and’, and ‘but’. Make sure you use the right linking word for the right idea!*
> 
> - *Remember, make sure your answers are not too long and not too short! They should be similar to how you’d answer them in a real conversation!*
> 
> - *Remember to show your grammar. When you’re asked a question in the present, don’t just answer in the present. Think - how can you use past, present or future to answer each question?*
> 
> - *Remember, if you don’t hear or understand a question, you can ask the examiner to repeat it. You won’t lose any marks for this!*
> 
> - *Sometimes you might need a second or two to think of your answer in Speaking Part 1. That’s normal! Learn some phrases to say to give yourself time to think.*
