## 1. [Band-structure calculation using hybrid functionals - VASP Wiki](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Band-structure_calculation_using_hybrid_functionals)

> Let us stress a significant difference between hybrid band-structure calculations and DFT band-structure calculations. The electronic charge density suffices for density functionals to define the Hamiltonian, and no regular **k** mesh is required during DFT band-structure calculations. However, if no regular **k** mesh is provided, the electronic charge density must be fixed during the DFT band-structure calculation by setting [ICHARG](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ICHARG "ICHARG")=11 in the [INCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/INCAR "INCAR") file.
