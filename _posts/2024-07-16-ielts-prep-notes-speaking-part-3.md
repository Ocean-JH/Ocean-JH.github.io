### Develop Answer

*Examiner*: Do you think famous people are good role models for young people?

*Student*: I would have to say that no, I don't.

- reasons - **The reason for this is** we only ever get a superficial idea of their lives.

- effects - **This results in** unrealistic expectations for young people.

- addition - **What's more**, fame can corrupt people, ethically speaking.

- examples - **For instance**, many movie stars become arrogant and antisocial.

- comparison - **Whereas** family members can actually give advice directly, movie stars are unreachable. We can't communicate with them and we can't get advice from them.

- opinion - **Personally, I feel** celebrities have a little too much influence on young people these days.



> **General advice:**
> 
> - *In Part 3 of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner asks you questions related to the topic of Part 2. However, these questions have a different focus to Part 1 and Part 2. While Part 1 and Part 2 are about you, Part 3 is about **people or the world in general**. The examiner wants to hear if you can **speak in general, give opinions (both yours and others‚Äô), justify views, and so on**. You can prepare well for this part of the test by thinking in advance about how you can talk about topics in general.*
> 
> - *When you practise for the IELTS Speaking test, make separate lists of all the things you could say in general about various topics. If you need inspiration, look on the internet for images or information to help you.*
> 
> - *In the IELTS Speaking test, you have to use a good range of vocabulary. When you have a basic list of words, think about how you can categorise these ideas. With a topic such as the environment, it is likely you will have to talk about the problems, causes and effects, for example. Also, move beyond single words. Think about how you can add adjectives to describe these words better. Think about which verbs you can use to describe the actions they relate to. Think about any synonyms you could use instead. You can use a dictionary or the internet to find new words if you need to.*
