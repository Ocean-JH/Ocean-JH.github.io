**Crystal Structure Prediction of Ge-Sb-Te System Based on Genetic Algorithm**
*[ Aug 2023 - Aug 2024 ]*
Utilizing a combination of genetic algorithms and first-principles methods, I conducted crystal structure prediction studies on the Ge-Sb-Te system, a pivotal phase change material system, to uncover its inherent complexities and expand our knowledge of its configuration space.
The objective was to enhance comprehension of this intriguing system and potentially identify novel structures or compositions conducive to phase-change storage applications.

**Machine learning potential accelerates crystal structure prediction**
*[ Jan 2024 â€“ Sep 2024 ]*
In this work, I have developed a framework combining genetic algorithm, and pre-trained potential, which can effectively locate the ground-state or meta-stable states of the relatively large/complex systems. Utilizing machine learning potentials (e.g., general pre-training potentials CHGNet, MACE, MEG, etc.) as energy evaluators instead of first principles methods can significantly expedite the process of crystal structure prediction and more effectively probe the potential energy surface.
