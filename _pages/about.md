Welcome to my blog! My name is Wang Jianghai(王江海, which means *ocean*  in Chinese). I am currently a postgraduate student in Beihang University:mortar_board:, majoring in computational materials science. My research focuses on crystal structure prediction and first-principles computation, and I am interested in the evolution of computational materials science led by artificial intelligence.


I will share my study and life experience here, I hope you can find resonance with me here!
