Welcome to my blog! My name is Wang Jianghai. I am currently a postgraduate student in Beihang University, majoring in computational materials science. My research focuses on crystal structure prediction and first-principles computation, and I am interested in the evolution of computational materials science led by artificial intelligence.

I will share my study and life experience here, I hope you can find resonance with me here!
