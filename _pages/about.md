Welcome to my blog! My name is Wang Jianghai(çŽ‹æ±Ÿæµ·, which means *ocean*  in Chinese). I am currently a postgraduate student in Beihang University, majoring in computational materials science. My research focuses on crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, and I am interested in the evolution of computational materials science led by artificial intelligence.

I will share my study notes here and I hope you enjoy the content!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:wang_jianghai@buaa.edu.cn) at any time if you find any errors in the content, or if you have suggestions for improvement!
